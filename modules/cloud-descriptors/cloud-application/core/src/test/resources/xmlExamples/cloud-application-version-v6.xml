        List of deployables
           The deployable sequence is sorted and describes to the loading order (at least for those that are collocated)  

	Type of deployable
           - JOnAS deployable (artefact or xml)
           - Apache deployable (static pages extracted from an artefact url)
           - DB deployable (artefact url including some sql scripts ?)
           - JVM deployable (jvm options and properties)
           - VM deployable (env variables definition)
	
        Requirements can be set for each deployable, each one in a query ldap format.

        SLA enforcement (health & elasticity configuration) can be set for each deployable.
        To note that SLA enforcement can be set both at platform layer (environment) and application layer (here).

        For V1, 
        - Only JOnAS deployable are supported.
        - Requirements are not checked
        - SLA enforcement configuration is not supported
